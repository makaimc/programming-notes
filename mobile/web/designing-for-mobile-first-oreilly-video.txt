Video 1: Why Care About Mobile?
-------------------------------
> major computing cycle with mobile, mobile consumer expected to grow to
  10+ billion (more devices than people) - number of devices today
  already at 6+ billion
> Amazon: > $1 billion spent on mobile devices over the past year
> PayPal: mobile transactions increased 6-fold in 2009: $25M to $141M
> 70% of PayPal mobile revenue comes from iPhone app
> massive growth in social apps with mobile
> Google mobile searches grew 130% in Q3 2010
> Q4 2010 - smartphones surpassed PCs/laptops for device shipments (globally)
> everything in mobile is happening faster than expected
> still in early shift in usage from home personal computers to mobile
> ~40% of people in the US have a smartphone
> new experiences created with mobile - people using their devices while
  out doing activities and out in the field (for example, searching 
  Zillow while out searching for real estate)

Video 2: Why Care About Mobile Web Experiences
----------------------------------------------
> don't most people just use native mobile apps on smartphones? no, mobile web growing
  expontentially as well
> twitter.com - 78% of users use, m.twitter.com - 14% of users use, drops to 8% on iPhone
> mobile web usage is growing allowside mobile traffic use
> mobile phones will overtake PCs as most common web access devices by 2013
> 600% growth to mobile websites (2010)
> top 50 websites only 40% of all mobile visits (lots of different sites in remaining 60%)
> what about native apps? mobile web becoming baseline and app is above that
> native apps offer deeper hardware access, multi-tasking, app & in-app sales, home screen
  placement on phone
> mobile web advantages: broad access, instant updates, real-time testing, HTML + CSS
> 10 current mobile OS platforms, many with small share but potential for growth
> AT&T mobile data traffic increased 50x in 3 years (beg. 2007- end 2009) - 4,932%
> new uses for mobile phones as people transition from personal computers

Video 3: Mobile Capabilities
----------------------------
> accelerometer - portrait versus landscape mode, create better experience by taking
  advantage of different screen dimensions
> location systems - GPS/wifi/cell towers, allow finer grainularity for an application
  to take advantage of
> direction detection in location systems, deliver relevant information based on location
  and direction you are traveling
> augmented reality based on combination of different capabilities (yelp & London Tube
  examples)
> mobile web - no digital compass or video camera access (yet)
> Android 3.0 + 4.0 - more access to device features from the browser
> rethinking interaction with new device features, such as tilting to scroll down/up in
  an article
> new ways of presenting & interacting with information

Video 4: Mobile Constraints
---------------------------
> factors to consider: small screen, battery, inconsistent network, fingers,
  sensors
> mobile is "intensely personal"
> 84% of people use their smartphones at home, 80% misc times, 74% waiting in
  line, 64% at work - just about anywhere, not just stereotypical places
> "the desktop is like diving, mobile is like snorkling"
> partial attention when using mobile devices requires a focused design
> iPad is mostly a bedtime device where users are mostly on in the evening
> desktop web is usually 1024x768 (minimum), smartphone now is about 320x480,
  so we've lost 80% of the screen space
> constraints of mobile help to focus on what people actually use
> optimizing for speed on mobile, if you're using much of the same code for
  the desktop, can help user experience on the desktop with the speed increase
> use CSS3 and canvas tags instead of images when possible to reduce file
  transfers
