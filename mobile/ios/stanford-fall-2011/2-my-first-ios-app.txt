Video 2: My First iOS App
-------------------------
> outlets you almost always make a weak connection because there is already 
  a strong connection for UI elements to the screen
> iOS uses the setter for the UILabel to set the pointer to the object
  displayed on screen, while we use the getter to retrieve the object
  and change the UILabel's attributes
> when you copy and paste a button, it copies its target action
> you can change the id type in a IBAction to be statically typed, such
  as UIButton *, so at compile time it will catch your errors
> NSLog is just like printf except it takes an NSString and sends it to
  the console
> %@ in an NSString represents an object
> self.display = [self display] // these are functionally equivalent
> lazy instantiation - waiting until the last possible part in the code
  to initiatize a variable
> synthesize never allocates memory itself
