iPhone and iPad User Interface Design
Found at: https://developer.apple.com/videos/ios/
-------------------------------------------------
> the goal for an app should be to make it: Useful, Intuitive, and Beautiful
> attributes of improving user interface design: focus, touch, animation,
  sound, language, typography, and graphics

Focus
-----
> focusing your app: provide a useful and elegant solution with feature
  set targeted to the problem you're solving
> an app should be highly focused on just the task(s) the user wants to do
> application definition statement: 1. what does the app do? and 2. who
  will use it? - both answers should be clear and focused
> continually refer back to the application definition statement
> example: "an alarm clock for business travelers" versus "an alarm clock
  for children"
> user interface should only contain the options that matter most - what
  matters right now (user's primary task)
> showcase the content people about about the most
> place less frequently used features in a secondary screen or a popover
> popover should update to only display options that matter in the current
  context

Touch
-----
> provide controls sized for a finger - minimum of 44x44 points for a tap
  target
> not all apps are used the same way or by the same people - example of
  Nike app with a huge pause button in the center of the screen
> apps targeted to children generally need more space between buttons and
  larger buttons
> provide adequate space between controls
> users expect immediate feedback when touching the screen (give feedback
  upon pressing)
> give texture and depth for a tactile look (shine, texture, depth)
> follow standard iOS conventions (rounded corners and chevrons)
> design controls to stand out from artwork

Animation
---------
> smooth transitions from one view to another (objects don't just appear and
  disappear in the real world - they shouldn't in an app either)
> communicate status and process with animation
> match the user's gesture in the app (animation following actual physics
  provides better realism)
> be realistic with animation otherwise the animation can confuse users
> for example, a "card" animation should only provide 2 sides

Sound
-----
> sound can add a heightened set of realism and provide an action with
  a result
> sound should not be the only form of feedback
> reinforce visual concept with sound (for example a shutter sound when
  taking a picture)
> sound is a must in games

Language
--------
> clear language is important because users are not as familiar with
  technologies and terminology behind it
> label buttons by resulting action (close and view buttons when you
  receive a text message)
> navigation bars at the top must be clearly labeled
> avoid placing a logo at the top of every view (takes up too much space)
> label back buttons by where they go to (labeling "back" doesn't help users
  because it is obvious that the button already takes them back)
> make language user-centric instead of based on technology
> file system is abstracted in iOS (instead of files you see "spreadsheets",
  "photos", and "songs") - terms should make sense to users

Typography
----------
> make the primary text stand out
> example: person's name who sent you an email in a list of emails
> subtle shading to distinguish content
> avoid too many font types and sizes

Graphics
--------
