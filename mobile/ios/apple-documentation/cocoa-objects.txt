Cocoa Objects
-------------
> Objective-C does not allow operator overloading, templates, or multiple
  inheritance
> Objective-C dynamism comes from three sources:
  1. Dynamic typing - class determination at runtime
  2. Dynamic binding - determining the method to invoke at runtime
  3. Dynamic loading - adding new modules to a program at runtime
> dynamic typing comes from the id data type, which can represent any
  Cocoa object
> method invocations are not bound to code during compilation - only
  bound when the message is actually delivered
