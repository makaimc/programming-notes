About Collections
-----------------
> a collection is a Foundation framework class for holding & manipulating groups
  of objects
> primary role as either array, dictionary, or set
> most collections only hold objects
> most collections have mutable and immutable versions
> collections share: enumeration, checking if an object is a member of
  a collection, and accessing individual elements
> mutable versions also include adding and removing objects
> arrays are best for ordered groups of elements
> dictionaries are best for unordered groups of elements with duplication;
  provide key-value pair accessibility
> sets are best for unordered groups of elements without duplication
> index sets (NSIndexSet and NSMutableIndexSet) are helper objects that add
  to standard array capabilities by allowing storage of a subset of an array
  by storing the indexes into the array rather than creating a new array
> index paths store the location of information in nested arrays (ease 
  management of nested arrays) - UITableView uses index paths to store
  locations within a table view
> to store pointeres or integers, use NSPointerArray, NSMapTable, or
  NSHashTable (similar to NSMutableArray, NSMutableDictionary, and
  NSMutableSet), which allow you to specify how to manage the collection's 
  contents
> copying and enumerating on collections utilities are provided by the Foundation
  framework
