> 7 ingredients to best apps on the App Store: delightful, innovative,
  optimized, connected, accessible, localized, designed

Delightful
----------
> inviting and provides a great first impression, also intuitive
  so that users do not need a manual to know how to use the app
> delightful apps are also engaging, they have a "hook" to get people to come
  back
> delightful apps are enabling, they allow people to do things that they
  could not do before
> delightful apps are exciting and generate enthusiasm with their attention
  to detail
> app should mimic the real world where possible
> an app should do one thing well and not try to do a lot of things
> "great apps sweat the details"

Innovative
----------
> inspirational - new categories of apps 
> examples: flight path (new category of gaming), app that identifies mountains
  based on GPS coordinates (augmented reality)
> Word Lens - translate from Spanish to English & back
> Scrabble - manage letters on iPhone and push to iPad

Optimized
---------
> high quality - stable, reliable
> high performance - fast, responsive
> platform integration - use existing frameworks instead of writing new ones
  because the existing ones are mature, debugged, and stable
> platform differentiated - developed specifically for iOS instead of
  cross-platform

Connected
---------
> app works well with other apps - for example, a telephone number clicked on
  will go to the phone app
> use the on-board personal information
> reach beyond the immediate phone (iPhone to iPhone) - for example, give your
  custom Starbucks order to another iPhone

Accessible
----------
> in the US, there are 10 million visually impaired people, 31 million hearing
  impaired, 12 million with learning disabilities
> about 1 in 5 useres have a disability
> use accessibility framework so everyone can use your app

Localized
---------
> App Store now in 90 countries
> use the same binaries with different localization files for language translation

Designed
--------
> the iPad becomes the app you're using
> think of the calendar app, the contact app (address book), maps, there are no
  traditional distractions that you have when multitasking on a regular computer
