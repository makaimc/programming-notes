> .h for header files, .m for source files, .mm for source files that can
  contain C++ code
> use #import to include header files in source code
> @interface used to begin interface declaration, @end used to end it
> parent class name delineated from class name by a :
> both strong and weak typing for variables containing objects allowed
> object references are pointers in Objective-C, declared by *
> strongly-typed object declarations have * in front of variable names
> id type implies a pointer
> two types of methods in Objective-C classes: instance and class
> instance methods are scoped to a particular instance of a class
> class method do not require the creation of an instance
> a - sign at the start of a method signature indicates an instance method
> to call a method, you must message an object
> a message is comprised of a method signature with parameters, for example:
  [myArray insertObject:anObject atIndex:0];
> messages can be nested, for example:
  [[myAppObject theArray] insertObject:[myAppObject objectToInsert] atIndex:0];
> accessor methods are instance methods used to get and set values of a 
  property of an object
> Objective-C uses a dot syntax for invoking accessor methods
