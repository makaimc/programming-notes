Percona Live MySQL DC - Jan. 11, 2012
Keynote - Peter Zaitsev
-----------------------
> proprietary software necessary in some cases and better to have
  proprietary options than no options at all
> Oracle new steward of MySQL, made contributions to 5.5 and 5.6
> good signs the community is being listened to
> Percona DB drop-in replacement for MySQL, optimized for high end
> Percona has optimizations for SSDs
> Maria DB - lead by MySQL founder Monty Widenius
> Drizzle - 100+ developers from many companies, micro kernel architecture,
  best used for new development because it is not a drop-in replacement
> Clustrix, SchoonerSQL are other interesting database MySQL-derived
  community projects
> Percona XtraDB Cluster - multi-threaded syncrhonous replication for InnoDB

Tom Daley - Dyn (DNS Services)
  What's your real tolerance?
-------------------------------
> Dyn has used MySQL for core operations since 1998
> DNS configuration data: guaranteed global transaction durability &
  replication out to the edges
> "CAP theorem sucks" - 430 ms of latency worldwide (and that's min
  theoretical latency)
> partition tolerance - sometimes data centers go offline for awhile then
  suddenly come back up again (is the data up to date?)
> figure out the absolute critical functionality, partition from the optional

Innodb Internals
  by Peter Zaitsev
------------------
> MySQL 5.5 current release
> MySQL 5.6 development release
> traditional OLTP engine, which emulates the Oracle architecture
> all data stored in tablespaces (single or multiple tablespaces)
> write-ahead logging - changes MUST be stored in the log files before they
  can be reflected in the tables
> tablespace format - collection of segments (which are like files)
> a segment is a number of extents, typically 64 of 16K page sizes
> smaller extents for very small objects
> Innodb has "index of organized tables"
> each index has both leaf node segment and non-leaf node segments
> special segments for rollback and inserting buffers
> logs are stored in a "circular" format where oldest ones are erased
  to make room for new ones
> only REDO operations are stored in the logs
> log record format is "physiological" - hybrid of physical and logical
> separate undo tablespace in MySQL 5.6
> MySQL normally uses a thread per connection (no more than 1 thread per
  connection)
> transactions handled through the threads
> complex queries can only be executed on a single CPU core at a time!
