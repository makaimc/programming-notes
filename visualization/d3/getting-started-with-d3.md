Getting Started With D3.js by *Mike Dewar*
==========================================

Chapter 1: Introduction
-----------------------
* Author recommends using [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) tool and 
  "use strict"; within the draw function to keep JavaScript code clean
* d3.json('url', function(d) {}); // retrieve json from url and issues callback
  to the function
* Author recommends using another language (such as Python) for doing data 
  manipulation then sending the cleaned data to D3
* store data as key value pairs, with the key as the name of what the data is and
  the data as the value. Do not store data as keys!
