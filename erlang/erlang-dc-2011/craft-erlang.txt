Crafty Erlang
  by Colin MacDonald
--------------------

> talk focuses on programming idioms of Erlang and patterns to apply
> "synergistic weirdness" - the "weirdness" of Erlang comes together
  and makes the language work, but that means you have to know the
  whole language well to create beautiful programs
> digression: why do you do recursion backwards? because the lists are
  singly linked lists, the key is that the lists are immutable, which
  allows efficient use of the list data structure
> * Review of a bowling game example program *
> Escript -> allows you to run Erlang as a script as if it were
  a scripting language like Python or Ruby
> Spooky -> web framework for Erlang, "minimum viable Erlang web framework"
