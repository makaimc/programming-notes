ErlangDC - Bootcamp (830am - noon)
----------------------------------

> strings don't exist in Erlang except as lists of ASCII characters
> atoms start with a lowercase
> variables start with an uppercase or _
> "full stop" is . (terminator)
> arity: number of arguments
> module must correspond to filename
> case statement for conditional evaluation
> clauses in case statements are separated by ;
> guards -> introduced by the reserved word 'when'
> you cannot created your own guards - used to be for historical reasons 
  but it is now because the designers do not want user-developed guards 
  to have side effects
> many built-in functions in Erlang are written in C for fast execution
> built-in functions are in the erlang module
> preference in Erlang culture is to have self-describing code
>
